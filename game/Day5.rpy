    "Frank walks in, looking disheveled."

    frank "You got any water?"

    bartender "Just the kind that comes in bottles."

    frank "Christ, you too?"

    bartender "It's the whole county, Frank. Actually... 9 counties."

    frank "Fuck...!"

    bartender "Yeah...Just gotta sit tight and wait 'til it passes."

    frank "Can't be good for business though... I'd imagine."

    bartender "You want a beer?"

    "Frank hesitates and sits down."
    frank "Yeah."

    "You hand him a beer."  

    bartender "No water to wash the dishes, so gotta stick to cans..."

    frank "'s'bout the same as my fuckin' house."

    bartender "Frank, I don't wanna be insensitive, but what is that smell?"

    frank "Oh, you like it? It's some of my old cologne. Can't shower so I gotta cover up the musk somehow. Had to scrounge around the back of my closet for it."

    bartender "I think it's gone bad..."

    frank "It's just how fancy cologne is."

    bartender "Fancy cologne smells like old jockstrap?"

    frank "Eh, what do you know?"

    "Some time passes. Elli comes in and sniffs the air."

    elysia "Evening, gentlemen. Shit, Frank, what's that smell?"

    frank "'Eau de toilette'."

    elysia "You're making it too easy. Just wanted to come by, make sure nobody's using the water."

    bartender "For the toilets, yeah, but that's it."

    elysia "Good to hear. Now, can I get a beer, please?" 

    "You hand her a can of beer." 

    elysia "No mug?"

    frank "Can't wash mugs."

    elysia "Right... That makes sense. Still adjusting to this."

    frank "Can't you do something about this?"

    elysia "What do you want me to do?"

    frank "Something. Arrest the assholes, anything!"

    elysia "Frank, you know I can't do that. I'm just a beat cop. The governor and the National Guard are working on a fix so we just have to sit tight. For now."

    frank "'Sit tight?' 'Sit tight?' What kind of bullshit is this? Everybody's waiting, nobody's doing anything." 

    elysia "People are sorting it out. Things are happening, we just gotta let it happen."

    frank "Things are happening, pfft. In the old days, some asshole poisons the town well, the sheriff'd gun 'em down."

    elysia "This ain't the Wild West, Frank."

    frank "We're all just sitting here, twiddling our thumbs, waiting for someone else to decide what happens to us. That's bullshit."

    "Frank stands up, scooting the stool he was sitting on back, almost tipping it over."

    elysia "Frank, where are you going?"

    frank "I'm gonna do something."

    elysia "Do what?"

    frank "I don't know yet."

    elysia "Sit back down. Come on, you didn't even finish your beer."

    frank "No, I'm done sitting and I'm done drinking. 'I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul.'"

    elysia "Frank, if you don't come back down, you'll force my hand."

    frank "And why's that?"

    elysia "Because I'm worried you're going to hurt someone."

    frank "Elli, the fuck do you think I'm going to do?"

    elysia "I don't know, but I'm your friend and I want you to sit with me and relax."

    "Frank's shoulders droop. He lumbers over and repositions the stool before sitting next to Elli."

    frank "Ah, hell, look at us. Squabbling, keeping each other down. This is what they want us to do."

    elysia "I know, I know. I'll grab the next round, so you just relax. Hey, is the game on?"

    "Braxton enters, looking exhausted."

    braxton "Wow, it is a nuthouse out there."

    frank "What's happening?"

    braxton "Well, the state said they're going to hold back on aid for now."
    
    braxton "They're hoping this thing passes, so folks were piling into Malmart trying to stock up on water while they still can."

    elysia "You manage to get anything?"

    braxton "A pack of bottled water and some sports drinks."

    "Braxton briefly mock fights."

    braxton "People weren't messing around, things got really tense."

    bartender "Sports drinks?"

    braxton "Yeah, not going to do me much good with bathing and stuff. At least they had my flavor: red."

    elysia "Oh, you don't have to worry about bathing. Learn a thing or two from Frank and douse yourself in some French shit."
    
    elysia "Can't worry about getting smelly if you're already reeking."

    bartender "Haha, that's enough. Leave Frank alone."

    frank "Thank you."

    braxton "Come here Frank, let me a get a whiff of you."
    
    braxton "Oh, that is..."
    
    braxton "......"

    frank "..."

    braxton "...potent."

    frank "I think it's nice."

    braxton "Got my eyes watering here."

    frank "Oh, not you, too."

    braxton "My girl said I wasn't sensitive enough. Hell, two seconds with Frank brought out the waterworks."

    frank "That's it, I'm going to sit at the end."

    "Frank stands up and moves to the farthest stool at the other end of the bar."

    elysia "Oh, Frank, no!"

    frank "Nope, I'm setting a flag here. Got my leper colony set up so none of you have to endure my odor. Just gonna sit here and enjoy the company of me, myself, and I."

    braxton "Oh, Frank, don't be like that. We were just kidding, is all. We didn't mean no harm. Come back to us."

    frank "No."

    elysia "Frank, you stubborn old mule. Come back here and drink with us."

    frank "Okay. But I don't want to hear nothing else about my smell, can we agree to that?"

    braxton "Fine by me."

    frank "Elli?"

    elysia "You won't hear a peep outta me."

    frank "All right then."

    "Frank gets settled back into his seat."

    braxton "There, now isn't that better?"

    elysia "Maybe we should get a fan going or something."

    frank "Oh, for fuck's sake."
